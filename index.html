          <h3>College Life</h3>
          <p>College life is not as easy as I used to think. It is a struggle in everyway. Nothing is easy and nothing can be taken for granted. everything is not just black and white or grey for that matter. We have to try very hard to keep our scores up and our grades good. But we have a good professors who guide us and lead us into the right path</p>
