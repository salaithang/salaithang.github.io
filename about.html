          <p>
            My name is Salai Thang and I am a senior, majoring in political science at Georgia State University. Before I came to the United State 16 years ago, I attended 2 years of college majoring in Economics back in Burma(Myanmar). After arriving the US in 2001, I have worked at different professions. I used to own two small sushi bars inside the Publix Supermarkets before my business was bankrupted by 2008 financial crisis. I am also a community activist/leader too. Since the arrival of many Burmese refugees from Burma beginning from 2007, I have been helping my community members with their integration into the new society. I have organized many festivals and training programs for the Burmese community and plan to start a non profit organization after graduating from GSU.

            In 2013, while working as a supervisor at a poultry firm, I decided to quit my job to get a bachelor degree from a university to effectively lead my community. So, I started my studies at Georgia Perimeter College in 2014 and now I am a senior at GSU. My ultimate goal upon graduation is to start a non profit community organization and help the refugees integration by organizing training programs and providing support services.
