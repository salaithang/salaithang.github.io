            Burmese Chin Community Of Atlanta is an organization established in 2008 to help the Burmese Chin Refugees settled in Atlanta,GA with their adjustments in the new society and also to maintain the culture and tradition they brought from their native land. I was one of the founding members of the organization and as an elected president for the next 2 years(2015-2016), I will be focusing to work with various NGO organizations to expand the social works among the Burmese Chin refugees.
